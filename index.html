      This Privacy Policy describes how personal information is collected, used, and shared when you install or use the App in connection with your Shopify store.

  <h2>Data Usage</h2>

    Our app may integrate with APIs (like OpenAI or ScrapingDog) to enhance functionality.
    These services follow their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review.
